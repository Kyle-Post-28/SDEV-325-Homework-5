# SDEV-325-Homework-5
For this assignment, I had to create two Java applications that are meant to highlight a specific vulnerability and a possible mitigation technique. There are two versions of each application. One version demonstrates the vulnerability and the other demonstrates a mitigation techinuqe put into place. The first vulnerability is a Improper Restrictions of Excessive Authentication Attempts and the second vulnerability is Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (in this case DES encryption). In addition to the code I have screen captured and documented everything in a MS word file. Enjoy!
